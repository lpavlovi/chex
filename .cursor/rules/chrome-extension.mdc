This project aims to build a Chrome Extension using Solid JS.
- All code and configuration should be compatible with Chrome Extension Manifest V3.
- Use the `@crxjs/vite-plugin` for building and bundling the extension.
- Place content scripts in the `src/content/` directory.
- The manifest file should be defined in `manifest.config.ts`.
- Use Vite for development and building; configure plugins as needed for Chrome Extensions.
- Follow best practices for permissions: only request those necessary for functionality.
- Keep popup UI files (e.g., `index.html`) in the root or `public/` directory.
- Use the `vite-plugin-zip-pack` to package the extension for release.
- Test the extension in Chrome using developer mode before publishing.
